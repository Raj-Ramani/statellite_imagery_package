This repository is designed for the creation of a library to analyse data from different instruments on-board a satellite. The instruments provide daily updates from a piece of land that can be used to track water levels at different locations. Aigean satellite data is used. 

This package is installable, with stringent tests, docucumentation, docstrings, and with command line interfaces to make analysing the data as accurate and thorough as possible. 

Within this package, an existing implementation of clustering.py was altered to make the running of the k-means algorithm more readable and efficient with a performance test to prove this improvement.

Ultimately, this package implements an easy-to-use Python library to analyse and visualise Aigean satellite data.
